            <h1>about...</h1>

                <p>"You have no idea how high I can fly" - Michael Scott portrayed by Steve Carrell in <em>The Office</em>,
                    season 5, episode 20. If you haven't watched this TV show, I recommend it.
                    Its an American adaptation of a British show, and features quirky, usually absurd situations in everyday lives
                    of working-class-joes. I think its important, to find the unordinary in the ordinary and make try to make fun
                    of the everyday situation. There's a lot of bad out there, so making the best of what we have
                    and having some laughs along the way is big.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    I don't take things too seriously. I like to joke and have others around me laugh and feel comfortable.
                    Making or creating things makes me feel excited, and I always am striving to learn and enhance my abilities.
                    Learning things day to day is incredibly important and can be seen across all aspects of life.
                    For example, I like making music in spare time. I can consistenly make something that I like and can be proud of, but 20 minutes later,
                    I might decide my masterpiece isn't as great as I initially thought. I build off what I have, and make something that doesn't sound like nails
                    on a chalkboard. It takes hard work to consciously take in information to become better at a task, but it is something I enjoy doing.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Web development makes me feel the same excitedness I experience from making an interesting new sound with a synthesizer.
                    It takes a lot of hard work and experimentation, but in the end, I can create something to be proud of. In the time being,
                    it might suck but with additional learning and practice, I can make something great.
                </p>
